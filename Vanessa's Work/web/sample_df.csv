Time tests of the slide showed that a tube with heavier patrons (combined weight 400 lbs) traveled down the slide an average of 5 seconds faster than a tube with lighter patrons (combined weight 250 lbs).State inspectors reviewed the operational procedures and performed an inspection.  Nothing was found physically wrong with the slide, but the inspectors did not hear the operators give the proscribed verbal instructions (lean back and hold the raft handles) to any of the guests prior to dispatch.  A requirement was written ordering the operators to give the safety talk to each guest prior to dispatch.

This attraction has sweeps, bumps, and 90-degree turns that simulate a raft going up against rocks and traveling down white water. The Division could see that at the 90-degree turn, the bottom of the attraction is beveled to make the front of the raft go up the wall, and not directly into the wall, allowing the rider?Ã‡Ã–s feet to swing away from the wall of the attraction. When they hit the wall with their feet hanging over the front of the tube, one badly sprained her ankle, and two dislocated their ankle. The Division also found that all of the injured were wearing some type of shoe or footwear while traveling down the attraction. Wearing footwear on this attraction could allow the foot to stick to the side of the slide because the slide is made of concreteand has a rubber-covered foam covering the concrete. This would cause excess force to be placed on the rider?Ã‡Ã–s foot, causing damage to the foot.State officials ordered the park to prohibit riders from wearing footwear, to change the max weight for a single tube rider from 250 to 200 pounds, and to change the front riding position on all multiple tubes so that the front rider sits with legs crossed instead of hanging over the front of the tube.",2006,"Redding, CA"
